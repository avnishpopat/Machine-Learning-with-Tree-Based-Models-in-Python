PART 1 - CLASSIFICATION AND REGRESSION TREES (CART)
- Set of supervised learning models used for problems involving classification and regression

Classification Tree
- Sequence of if-else questions about individual features
- Objective: Infer class labels
- Able to capture non-linear relationships between features and labels
- Don't require feature scaling. For example, it do not need standardization etc.

Decision regions 
- Decision region is the region in the feature space where all the instances are assigned to one class label.
- For example, if result is of two class Pass or Fail. Then there will be 2 decision region. One is Pass region other is Fail region.

Decision boundary
- It is the seperating boundary between two region.
- In above example, decision boundary will be 33% (which is the passing marks)
